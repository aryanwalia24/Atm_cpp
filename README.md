# Atm_cpp
ATM Simulation using C++ and advanced Data Structures.

This project is an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation implemented in C++. It provides a command-line interface for users to perform various banking operations, such as checking transaction history, making withdrawals, deposits, and transfers.

Features:
- User authentication using account number and PIN
- Transaction history display
- Withdrawal functionality with validation for amount and balance
- Deposit functionality with validation for amount
- Transfer functionality with validation for amount, recipient account number, and balance
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Option to exit the program

The project is structured using classes and utilizes concepts like maps, vectors, and static methods. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and showcases the usage of C++ features such as classes, functions, loops, conditional statements, and standard input/output.

To run the program, simply compile and execute the code. The user can choose to log in with an existing account or create a new account. Once logged in, they can select from a menu of available operations. The program provides feedback and updates the account balances accordingly.

This ATM simulation project serves as a learning exercise for C++ programming and demonstrates the implementation of basic banking functionalities. Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the code as needed.
